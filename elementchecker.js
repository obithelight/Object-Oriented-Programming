/*
Create a function named elementChecker that will check a passed in array if at least one of its elements has the same value as a passed in argument. If array is empty, return the message "error - passed in array is empty". Otherwise, return a boolean value depending on the result of the check. Use the students array and the string "Jane" as arguments when testing.
